## Installation

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the libraries from the requirements.txt file; running the script should take care of it for you.
3. Ensure your version of R is compatible with the libraries. The last time I ran the script, I used R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt) -- "Eye Holes"
4. Change the filepaths of datasets to match your machine's filepaths.
