# Nielsen Data Analysis for RSG Media

## Description

In a real-world application that intersected with academic coursework, I analyzed Nielsen data for RSG Media as part of an interview process, later submitting this analysis for my Information Visualization, IST 719. 

### Motivation

I wanted to apply the skills I'd learned in my Data Visualization course to an interesting dataset, and RSG happened to provide an excellent opportunity to do so. 

### Problems Addressed

I sought to sift through this massive Nielsen dataset in order to discover insight into viewer demographics and behavior. 

### Learning Experience

Throughout the project, I delved into the intricacies of Nielsen data, enhancing proficiency in R for data analysis and visualization. The process provided hands-on experience in translating technical insights into clear, visually compelling formats.

## Impact and Results
- Effectively answered the open-ended question, "what stories does this dataset tell?"
- The project's success led to an internship offer from RSG Media, affirming the practical application and relevance of skills developed in IST 719.

## Installation

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the libraries from the script. For specifics about versions and dependencies, see the requirements.txt file.
3. Ensure your version of R is compatible with the libraries. The last time I ran the script, I used R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31 ucrt) -- "Eye Holes"
4. Change the filepaths of datasets to match your machine's filepaths.

## Usage

### Data Analysis 

Employed R for in-depth data analysis, focusing on viewership patterns, genre preferences, and network performance.

### Visualization 

Created visualizations to highlight key findings, including audience preferences and viewership trends.

### Report and Poster Creation 

Compiled findings into a comprehensive report and an engaging poster, showcasing both analytical depth and visual communication skills.

## Future Development

I would like to recreate the ggplot2 functions in Python using appropriate libraries.
